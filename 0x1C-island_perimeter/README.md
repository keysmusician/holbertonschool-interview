## Prompt
Create a function that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid:

- `grid` is a list of list of integers:
  - 0 represents water
  - 1 represents land
  - Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
  - Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally)
  - The grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
- The grid is completely surrounded by water
- There is only one island (or nothing)
- The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water surrounding the island)

Function prototype: `def island_perimeter(grid)`
