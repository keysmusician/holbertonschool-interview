"""
Reads stdin line by line and computes metrics.

The prompt was phrased rather poorly in two ways:
1) The prompt gives the following format:
    <IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code>
    <file size>

    It goes on to state, "If the format is not this one, the line must be
    skipped." Yet the following line is supposed to be read, even though there
    is a modification to the whitespace in the format:

    188.213.11.218-[2017-02-05 23:31:21.690755] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1"
    401 1000

2) The prompt gives two conditions for printing metrics:
    "After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), print
    these statistics from the beginning:"

    It does not say to print when finished reading stdin, even though it is
    expecting that as well.
